    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>Trout meunière is the lightest, freshest, most clean way to enjoy fish I know of. It's coated and pan-fried golden brown and topped with a lemony sauce. Classic, easy, and delicious.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 (6 ounce) fillets boneless, skin-on rainbow trout fillets, patted dry</li>
        <li>¾ teaspoon kosher salt, divided</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon finely ground black pepper</li>
        <li>½ cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons ghee (clarified butter)</li>
        <li>6 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons finely chopped shallot</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons fresh lemon juice</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons finely chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley</li>
        <li>lemon wedges, for serving</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 200 degrees F (93 degrees C). Line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper and set aside.</li>
        <li>Season trout fillets evenly with 1/2 teaspoon salt and pepper. Lightly dredge each fillet in flour, shaking off excess flour.</li>
        <li>Heat ghee over medium-high in a large skillet. When butter shimmers, add fish fillets skin-side down, cooking in batches if necessary. Cook for 2 to 3 minutes, flip, and continue cooking until the outside is lightly golden brown, and fish is just cooked through and opaque, 1 to 2 minutes. Remove cooked fish to the prepared baking sheet and place in the preheated oven to keep warm.</li>
        <li>Pour excess ghee or clarified butter from skillet; wipe skillet clean. Add unsalted butter and shallot to the skillet and cook briefly over medium heat until butter is melted and shallot has softened a bit, about 1 minute. Stir in lemon juice and season with remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt. Allow mixture to cook for about 30 seconds. Remove from heat, and stir in parsley.</li>
        <li>Place fish fillets on plates or a platter; top with sauce from skillet and serve immediately with lemon wedges on the side.</li>
    </ol>
