    <h1>Brookies (Brownie Cookies)</h1>
    <img src="../recipes/images/brownie.jpeg">
    <h2>Description: </h2>
    <p>This brookie recipe was inspired by a co-worker who couldn't decide if she wanted brownies or chocolate chip cookies for her birthday treat. Since she said I should just pick one, I thought this up on the way home. I couldn't find a recipe like it on Allrecipes, so I created it. These brookies go quickly; I usually make a double batch in a jelly roll pan.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients: </h2>
    <h3>Cookie Layer:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>½ cup butter, softened</li>
        <li>½ cup light brown sugar</li>
        <li>¼ cup white sugar</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>1 ¼ cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>1 cup semisweet chocolate chips</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Brownie Layer:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
        <li>½ cup butter, melted</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>⅓ cup cocoa powder</li>
        <li>½ cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon baking powder</li>
        <li>⅛ teaspoon salt</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.</li>
        <li>Prepare cookie layer: Beat butter, brown sugar, white sugar, and vanilla in a large bowl until creamy. Add egg; beat until light and creamy, about 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Whisk together flour, salt, and baking soda in a bowl. Gradually stir flour mixture into butter mixture until dough is combined. Stir chocolate chips into dough. Spread dough evenly into the prepared baking dish; set aside.</li>
        <li>Prepare brownie layer: Stir together sugar, melted butter, and vanilla in a bowl; add eggs and beat well. Mix in cocoa powder until well-combined. Stir in flour, baking powder, and salt until batter is combined. Pour over cookie layer and spread to cover completely.</li>        
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 20 to 25 minutes. Cool completely before cutting into 20 bars.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Tips:</h2>
    <p>You can use store-bought chocolate chip cookie dough instead of making the cookies.</p>
